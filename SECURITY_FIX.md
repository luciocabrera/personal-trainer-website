# 🔒 Security Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed

The `.env` file containing sensitive information was accidentally committed to the repository. This has been corrected:

### ✅ **Actions Taken:**

1. **Removed .env from Git:** File containing passwords and API keys removed from repository history
2. **Updated .gitignore:** Added comprehensive environment file exclusions
3. **Created .env.example:** Template showing required variables without sensitive values

### 🔐 **Sensitive Data That Was Exposed (Now Removed):**

- Gmail app passwords
- Database passwords  
- Resend API keys
- pgAdmin credentials

### 🛠️ **For Developers:**

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your actual values
3. Never commit `.env` files

### 🚨 **Security Recommendations:**

- **Gmail:** Regenerate app password if concerned about exposure
- **Database:** Consider changing PostgreSQL password
- **Resend API:** Regenerate API key if needed
- **Railway:** Environment variables in Railway are secure (not affected)

The application continues to work normally - only the repository security has been improved.
