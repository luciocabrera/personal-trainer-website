You train hard, but are you **fueling smart**? What you eat has a massive impact on your workout performance, recovery, and results. Let's break down simple, practical nutrition strategies that actually work!

## The Foundation: Nutrition Basics 🎯

### It's Not About Perfection, It's About Progress

Forget extreme diets and complicated meal plans. **Sustainable nutrition** is about making better choices most of the time. The 80/20 rule works wonders: eat nutritiously 80% of the time, enjoy life 20% of the time.

## Pre-Workout Nutrition: Fuel Up Right ⚡

### Timing Matters

**1-2 hours before training:**
- Eat a **balanced meal** with carbs and protein
- Example: Oatmeal with banana and almond butter
- Or: Whole grain toast with eggs

**30 minutes before:**
- If you need a quick boost: **small carb snack**
- Banana, apple, or handful of dates
- Keep it light!

### What to Eat

**Good pre-workout options:**
- 🍌 Bananas (quick energy)
- 🥜 Handful of nuts (sustained energy)
- 🍞 Whole grain bread with peanut butter
- 🥣 Oatmeal with berries
- 🍎 Apple slices with almond butter

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Heavy, fatty meals
